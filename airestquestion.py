    biryani : have you eat is regularly ? or weekly or monthly ?
    karahi : have you eat is regularly ? or weekly or monthly ?
    bbq : have you eat is regularly ? or weekly or monthly ?
    
    regularly - do you want to eat - bombay biryani ? sindhi biryani ? hyderabadi birani ?
    or something different in rice ?
    if bombay biryani .. special daigh biryani / plate
       if daigh? above (10person / 1.5) * 1 daigh
       if plate ? = above (8 , 6, 4 , 2 person ) * plate biryani
             remaining_amt = budget - bill 
       ---  if remaining_amt >= 1000 and remaining_amt <= 5000:
           meetha = kunafah (2500) , brownie (1100) , three milk cake (3500)
            if remaining_amt < 1000 and remaining_amt >= 500 :
            meetha = gulab jamun with icecream 650 , choclateicecream (900)    
            
    or something different in rice ?
    else :
        input = do you like mutton or chicken ?
        if mutton = mandi platter with dhumphukht for you
        (1 , 2 if budget is between 2000 to 4000)
        if chicken = mandbi platter with chicken sajji for you
        (1 , 2 if budget is between 5000 to 4000)
        
        remaining_amt = budget - bill 
       ---  if remaining_amt >= 1000 and remaining_amt <= 5000:
           meetha = kunafah (2500) , brownie (1100) , three milk cake (3500)
            if remaining_amt < 1000 and remaining_amt >= 500 :
            meetha = gulab jamun with icecream 650 , choclateicecream (900)
            
            same logic for other biryani
